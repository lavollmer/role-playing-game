//The let keyword tells JavaScript you are declaring a variable.
//Variables can be assigned a value. When you do this while you declare it, this is called initialization.
let xp = 0;
let health = 100;
let gold = 50;

// An array can be used to hold multiple values.
let inventory = ["stick", "dagger", "sword"];

//JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM. The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML. You can access the HTML using the document object, which represents your entire HTML document.
//One method for finding specific elements in your HTML is using the querySelector() method. The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches that selector.
let button1 = document.querySelector("#button1");
